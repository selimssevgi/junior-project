# Junior Project
It was my junior project in the third year of studying. 
Main idea was to help people finding movies based on their preferences without
spending too much time looking here and there. Read more on the paper.

# To-Dos

* pull movie from db and check if it has at least 10 similar movies, if not
  find similar movies. also show random 4 movies
